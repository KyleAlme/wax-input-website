# Project Overview    
This is a "concept" website I have create for my friends band, Wax Input. You can follow their bands instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/wax.input/?hl=en). I call it a "concept" website since I don't expect to get this website, or at least this version, for use. This is mainly a side-project for me to get more familiar with React, Tailwind, and web design overall.

If you want to check out the website click <a href="https://kylealme.github.io/wax-input-website/" target="_blank">here</a>.   

Please Note: This project is currently a WIP and is not near completion yet. Once it is, any "real" deployment of the final product will likely be heavily altered.
